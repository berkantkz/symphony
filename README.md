### Notes:
* You don't need to mind the special characters as Javascript will parse them. This is valid for the characters like ```?, !, -, #, and space ( )``` and some characters that are available in my own language such as ```ö, ç, ü, ğ, ş``` etc. I didn't test and I also don't know if it would work for the special characters that are from any other language.
